            <h1>Claremont Rug Company</h1>
            <p>I wrote product descriptions for connoisseur level Persian carpets along with educational articles on the website and appraisal letters sent to customers after purchase.</p>
            <p>The tone is often flowery and visual, designed for an audience with an interest in fine art and accustomed to the six figure price it often commands.</p>
            <p>Like any rare artform, they are viewed as investments or potential heirlooms and the text is intended to reflect that status.</p>

              <h3>Ferahan Sarouk, West Central Persian</h3>
              <h4 class="text-gray">Connoisseur Caliber</h4>
              <p>This Persian Ferahan Sarouk is a beautiful example of the rarely found "Vase" design occasionally seen in 19th century pieces. It makes a wonderfully bold statement with the clean lines of its rich, oxford blue Vase device, which supports an eight pointed star motif in shades of currant and parchment.</p>
              <p>Filling out the main field is a cascade of gorgeous leaves, fastidiously depicted in celadon, currant, crimson, and marmalade. An effective use of color in a distinctly autumn palette evokes a warmer feel with a crisp edge. The border offers a slight contrast with its darker background and subtle abrash in the celadon motifs that run its entire length.</p>

              <h3>Tehran North Central Persian</h3>
              <h4 class="text-gray">4' 10" x 6' 11" â€” Circa 1900</h4>
              <p>At over 100 years old, this classical antique rug is preserved in impeccable condition.</p>
              <p>Upholding Tehran's reputation for very finely woven, stylized botanical carpets, it features a stunning display of finely wrought detail, a highly intricate and compact design, and a gorgeous palette of elegant colors.</p>
              <p>The main field depicts a tree of flowing branches and waving leaves, constructed in an almost mosaic fashion, producing patterns within patterns. It creates a graceful sense of movement that erupts in a wondrously overflowing canopy at the top, then unfurls back down the rug.</p>
              <p>The liberal use of scarcely found green tones throughout the design adds to the rug's prodigious appeal.</p>
